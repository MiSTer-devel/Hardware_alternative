I uploaded the files on 08 Nov 2019 based on XXS 128 design. It's not tested but with minor
changes to fit the official IO addon: smaller PCB, inverter on the bottom side and changed the
position of capacitors. I will upload with new picture when available, but at the moment this
is a XXS 128 for reference:
